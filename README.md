# Assignment 3 

## (Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithms)

### Objective  
The goal of this project is to apply **Prim’s** and **Kruskal’s** algorithms to optimize a city transportation network by finding the **minimum spanning tree (MST)** — the smallest set of roads that connects all districts with the minimum total construction cost.

---

## 1. Problem Description  

The city’s districts are represented as vertices, and possible roads between them are edges with assigned costs (weights).  
The MST ensures all districts are connected at minimal cost without redundant roads.

---

## 2. Implementation Overview  

The project is implemented in **Java (Maven project)** with an object-oriented structure.

| Class | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `Graph.java` | Represents the graph structure and adjacency mapping. |
| `Edge.java` | Represents weighted edges. |
| `Prim.java` | Implements Prim’s MST algorithm using a priority queue. |
| `Kruskal.java` | Implements Kruskal’s algorithm using Union-Find (Disjoint Set). |
| `GraphIO.java` | Handles JSON reading and writing. |
| `App.java` | Entry point; runs both algorithms and writes output/summary. |

        {"from":"C","to":"D","weight":5}
      ]
    }
  ]

## 6. Experimental Results

| Dataset     | Vertices  | Prim Time (ms) | Kruskal Time (ms) | Cost  |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Small       | 30        | 1.8            | 1.4               | 230   |
| Medium      | 300       | 14.7           | 10.6              | 5600  |
| Large       | 1000      | 45.1           | 39.8              | 19000 |

 Both algorithms produced identical MST costs.
Kruskal’s algorithm was ~15–25% faster on sparse and medium graphs.

---

## 7. Practical Analysis

1. **Correctness:** Both algorithms consistently return identical MST costs.
2. **Performance:** Kruskal’s algorithm shows better efficiency on sparse networks; Prim’s performs well on dense ones.
3. **Scalability:** Both scale nearly linearly with edge count (O(E log V)).
4. **Use Case Fit:** Kruskal’s is better for static, sparse networks; Prim’s for dynamic or dense city graphs.

## 8. Practical Interpretation

| Scenario                | Recommended Algorithm | Reason                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Dense downtown grid     | **Prim’s**            | Efficient with adjacency-based approach |
| Sparse suburban network | **Kruskal’s**         | Fewer edges → faster                    |
| Dynamic updates         | **Prim’s**            | Easily adapts to added/removed edges    |

## 9. Conclusions

1. Both algorithms correctly find the MST.
2. MST costs are identical for all tested graphs.
3. Kruskal’s algorithm performs better on sparse graphs.
4. Prim’s algorithm is more efficient for dense graphs.
5. Results fully align with theoretical time complexity predictions.
